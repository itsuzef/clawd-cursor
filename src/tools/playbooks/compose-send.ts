/**
 * compose-send playbook.
 *
 * App-agnostic keyboard choreography for "fill a compose form and submit":
 *   1. open a new compose window (mod+n is the cross-app convention)
 *   2. type the To value (the first field auto-focuses on every mail client)
 *   3. Tab past optional Cc/Bcc rows — count is platform-aware (see TAB_BUDGET)
 *   4. type the Subject (or skip if empty — but still advance one Tab to body)
 *   5. type the Body
 *   6. mod+Return to submit (cross-app send shortcut)
 *
 * Naming: this is named for the CAPABILITY, not for any specific app. The
 * same choreography works for any "compose with To/Subject/Body fields and
 * submit on mod+Return" form. The first-class path for email is
 * open_uri(mailto: ...) — use this playbook only when:
 *   - the user explicitly wants to compose inside the app's native UI, OR
 *   - the URI handler is broken / not registered on the user's machine.
 *
 * Zero app-specific branches. Zero title-bar matching.
 *
 * v0.9.1 fix: previous version hard-coded TWO Tabs after the recipient
 * (assuming Cc/Bcc are always visible) AND coupled the post-subject Tab
 * to `if (subject)`. On macOS Mail.app's default layout (Cc/Bcc collapsed)
 * the doubled Tab overshoots Subject and lands on Body; if the user task
 * had no explicit subject (e.g. "send an email introducing yourself") the
 * subject-step was skipped entirely AND so was its advance Tab — so body
 * got typed wherever focus happened to be, often the Body field directly,
 * but also frequently collided with Subject if Cc/Bcc were enabled. Both
 * cases were caught by the trailing summary's empty `subject=` field but
 * the playbook still returned success=true unconditionally and the
 * pipeline was exempting playbooks from the verifier (separate fix in
 * pipeline.ts). Result: false-positive "✅ done" on a broken send. Real
 * user report on macOS 12+/Apple Mail.

/**
 * Number of Tab keys needed to advance from the To field to the Subject
 * field, by platform / default app behavior.
 *
 *   - **macOS** (Mail.app default): Cc/Bcc are collapsed by default in the
 *     compose window. Tab order: To → Subject → Body. ONE Tab after To.
 *     (If the user has "Always show Cc/Bcc" enabled in Mail prefs the count
 *     is wrong — there's no clean way to detect that from here. Users in
 *     that minority case should toggle the pref or use the mailto: route.)
 *
 *   - **Windows** (Outlook desktop default): Cc/Bcc visible inline. Tab
 *     order: To → Cc → Bcc → Subject → Body. THREE Tabs after To.
 *     Note: Windows usually hits this playbook via Strategy 1 (mailto:)
 *     in pipeline.ts which pre-fills everything via the URI; Strategy 2
 *     (this in-app path) is a fallback when mailto fails.
 *
 *   - **Linux/Wayland** (Thunderbird default): Tab order matches macOS.
 *     ONE Tab after To.
 *
 * The web variants (Gmail web, Outlook web) are a wildcard — different
 * apps in different browsers behave differently. The verifier (re-enabled
 * for playbooks in v0.9.1) catches false-success regardless.
