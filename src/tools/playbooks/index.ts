/**
 * Playbook registry.
 *
 * Playbooks are app-AGNOSTIC keyboard choreographies for known capability
 * shapes the vision loop would otherwise re-discover on every run. They
 * are NOT app-specific shortcuts. Each playbook implements ONE capability
 * (e.g. "compose+submit a form with To/Subject/Body fields") and works
 * across every app that follows the same UX convention.
 *
 * Dispatch: matchPlaybook routes by CAPABILITY (the user's intent),
 * never by app name. This is the key rule: if the same user intent
 * routes to two different playbooks because the active app changed,
 * the playbooks should be merged.
 *
 * Dispatched by the pipeline as a first-class Strategy ('playbook') sitting
 * between the router and the LLM ladder; NOT exposed on the public MCP
 * surface. compose-send specifically prefers the OS protocol-handler path
 * (mailto://, tel://, slack://, vscode://, ...) via
 * resolveSchemeHandlerExecutable + launchHandlerAndVerify; the in-app
 * keyboard choreography here is the fallback when no protocol handler is
 * registered or the dispatched window never appears.
 *
 * Each playbook is a pure function over PlatformAdapter + args. No
 * per-playbook state, no retries (that's the verifier's job).
