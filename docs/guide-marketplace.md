# ClawdCursor Guides Marketplace

Status: live. Client implementation shipped in v0.9 Phase 3; the server-side
repo went live the same release. This doc is the architecture spec.

- **Public URL**: <https://clawdcursor.com/app-guides>
- **Source repo**: <https://github.com/AmrDab/clawdcursor-guides>
- **Submissions**: PRs to the source repo. See its `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Why

clawdcursor's blind/hybrid/vision agents reason about every app from
screenshots and a11y trees. That works for any app on the planet, but it's
slow and brittle for popular apps where the keyboard shortcuts, workflow
patterns, and failure modes are well-known. Bundling that knowledge inside
the binary gives a free 5-10× speedup for those apps — but bundling every
known app inflates the binary and the bundle lags behind UI changes.

**The marketplace separates the binary release cycle from the knowledge
release cycle.** clawdcursor ships minimum core knowledge (currently
msedge + notepad) and fetches the rest on demand from a public GitHub
repo. Community contributions land via Pull Requests. Frequently-used
guides survive in a local LRU cache; rare ones get re-fetched when
needed. The agent never blocks on the network — if a guide isn't local
and the registry is unreachable, the agent reasons from first principles
like it does for any unknown app.

## Cache locations

| Path | Purpose | Writer | Reader |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| `src/llm/knowledge/guides/` | Bundled minimum core. Shipped in the binary. | maintainer commits | `loadGuide` last-resort fallback |
| `seed-registry/guides/` | Source files for the GitHub registry. Not bundled. | maintainer commits | uploaded to the GitHub repo |
| `~/.clawdcursor/guide-cache/` | LRU + TTL cache populated by `fetchGuide`. | `setCached` (auto) | `loadGuide` second-priority |
| `~/.clawdcursor/ui-knowledge/` | User overrides + `learn_app` writes. | `saveLearnedLesson`, `mergeIntoUserGuide` | `loadGuide` highest-priority |

`CLAWD_HOME` overrides `~/` for both cache locations.

```

Guides live at the **root** of the repo (not under `guides/`) so any
static-file hosting layer can serve them at `clawdcursor.com/app-guides/<app>.json`
without path rewriting.

### `<app>.json`

The same `AppGuide` schema clawdcursor uses internally. See
[`src/core/pipeline-types.ts`](../src/core/pipeline-types.ts) and
[`seed-registry/guides/youtube.json`](../seed-registry/guides/youtube.json)
for a reference example. Required fields: `app`, plus at least one of
`shortcuts` / `workflows` / `tips` / `layout`. The client linter at
[`src/llm/knowledge/guide-linter.ts`](../src/llm/knowledge/guide-linter.ts)
runs both client-side (defense-in-depth) and as the validate.yml CI step
(vendored copy at `scripts/lint-guide.mjs` in the guides repo — must
stay in sync, see the SYNC RULE comment in that file).

### `index.json`

Auto-generated from `guides/` content + vote-issue reactions. Schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2026-05-13T12:34:56Z",
  "guides": {
    "youtube": {
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "trust": "verified",
      "upvotes": 42,
      "downvotes": 1,
      "submitter": "@user",
      "etag": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

- `trust`: `verified` (curated by maintainers), `community` (vetted but
  user-contributed), `experimental` (un-vetted, opt-in). Maintainers set
  the level on PR merge via a label.
- `upvotes` / `downvotes`: count of 👍 / 👎 reactions on the corresponding
  `vote: <app>` issue. Aggregated nightly.
- `version`: semver, bumped on each merged PR.
- `etag`: content hash, used by the client for conditional GETs.

### Voting

Each guide has a corresponding GitHub Issue titled `vote: <app>`,
created automatically when the guide is first merged. Voters react with
👍 or 👎 on the issue. The aggregate.yml workflow counts reactions and
writes the totals into `index.json`. Native GitHub identity means voters
are rate-limited + bot-resistant without us building user accounts.

## Trust model

- **verified**: curated by maintainers. Default trust level the client
  accepts. ~12 guides on launch.
- **community**: user-submitted via PR, passed CI lint + schema, merged
  by a maintainer. Fetched if `CLAWD_TRUST_COMMUNITY_GUIDES=1` or the
  user enabled it through the doctor flow.
- **experimental**: same as community but the maintainer flagged it as
  unstable / un-vetted. Fetched only when explicitly requested by app
  name (`clawdcursor guides install youtube-experimental`).

Every guide loaded — bundled, cached, user-override, or freshly fetched
— runs through `lintGuide` before injection into the agent prompt.
Defense-in-depth catches:
- Schema violations (missing required fields, wrong types)
- Prompt-injection patterns ("ignore previous instructions", fake `<system>` tags, persona overrides)
- Dangerous prose (unconditional delete/transfer/purchase verbs, "never confirm" patterns)
- Domain hints that look like URLs / paths (must be bare domains)
- Oversize files (>64 KB → rejected)

A guide that fails lint is silently dropped. The agent falls back to
first-principles reasoning, same as for any unknown app.

## Client behavior

### Fetch policy
1. First call for an app this session: check disk cache.
2. Cache fresh (<7 days): use it, increment usageCount.
3. Cache stale OR missing: fire `prefetchGuideForApp(app)` in the
   background. Current task uses whatever's local; next task gets fresh.
4. Cache miss + bundled exists: bundled wins for current task.
5. Cache miss + no bundle + remote available: blocking fetch — first
   touch is slower but every subsequent touch is fast.
6. Network unreachable + stale cache: serve stale (offline tolerance).

### Cache eviction
- LRU with 50-entry cap (see `CACHE_INTERNALS.LRU_CAPACITY`).
- `usageCount` bumps reorder LRU on every cache hit — popular guides
  survive even when not most-recently-fetched.
- Per-file size cap 256 KB. Total cache size bounded by 50 × 256 KB = 12 MB.

### Environment variables
| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `CLAWD_GUIDES_REGISTRY_URL` | `https://clawdcursor.com/app-guides` | Base URL for fetches |
| `CLAWD_GUIDES_REGISTRY_OFF` | unset | `1` to disable all remote fetches (bundled-only mode) |
| `CLAWD_GUIDES_FETCH_TIMEOUT` | `4000` | Fetch timeout in ms |
| `CLAWD_BUNDLED_GUIDES_DIR` | the build dir | Override bundle path (used by tests) |
| `CLAWD_HOME` | `~/` | Cache + user-override root |
| `CLAWD_GUIDES_REPO_URL` | the GH repo | Used by `submit` instruction strings |

## What's live

Phase 3 shipped both the client and the server-side repo:

| Layer | Status | Where |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Client linter, cache, remote-loader, CLI | shipped in clawdcursor v0.9.0 | `src/llm/knowledge/` |
| Public registry repo | live | <https://github.com/AmrDab/clawdcursor-guides> |
| Initial 10 verified guides | seeded | discord, excel, figma, gmail, mspaint, olk, outlook, slack, spotify, youtube |
| Vote-issues for ratings | seeded (👍/👎 each on their own issue) | `Issues` tab of the guides repo |
| Validate CI on every PR | wired | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` |
| Nightly index aggregation | wired (06:00 UTC) | `.github/workflows/aggregate.yml` |
| Public URL routing | pending: `clawdcursor.com/app-guides` → guides repo | DNS / hosting config |

## What's left for full live operation

The client defaults to `https://clawdcursor.com/app-guides`. That URL
needs to map to the GitHub repo's raw content. Two options:

### Option A — Cloudflare / Vercel rewrite (recommended)

Add a route on clawdcursor.com that proxies `/app-guides/*` →
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmrDab/clawdcursor-guides/main/*`.

Cloudflare Worker example:
```js
addEventListener('fetch', e => {
  const url = new URL(e.request.url);
  if (url.pathname.startsWith('/app-guides/')) {
    const file = url.pathname.replace('/app-guides/', '');
    return e.respondWith(fetch(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmrDab/clawdcursor-guides/main/${file}`));
  }
  return e.respondWith(fetch(e.request));
});
```

### Option B — GitHub Pages with custom domain

Enable Pages on the guides repo with custom domain `app-guides.clawdcursor.com`.
Then change `CLAWD_GUIDES_REGISTRY_URL` to that subdomain in a follow-up
clawdcursor release. (Slightly worse: path is on a subdomain, not the
main site; requires a separate clawdcursor release to switch URLs.)

### Option C — Use the raw GitHub URL directly (interim)

Set `CLAWD_GUIDES_REGISTRY_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmrDab/clawdcursor-guides/main`
as an environment variable, or change the default in
`src/llm/knowledge/remote-loader.ts`. Works today with zero hosting setup
but every install hits GitHub directly — fine for low traffic, rate-limited
on heavy use.
