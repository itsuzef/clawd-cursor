## One-line summary

clawdcursor is the skill that gives AI agents a cursor and a keyboard on a real
desktop. Open source (MIT). If a human can do it on a screen, you can too — no
app-specific API required.

## Two ways to connect

**MCP (recommended for Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf / Zed):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clawdcursor": { "command": "clawdcursor", "args": ["mcp", "--compact"] }
  }
}
```
You see 6 compound tools: `computer`, `accessibility`, `window`, `system`,
`browser`, `task`.

**MCP HTTP (for any HTTP-capable agent):**
```bash
clawdcursor agent           # full daemon (with autonomous submit_task)
clawdcursor agent --no-llm  # tool surface only; skips built-in brain, scheduler startup, and credential validation
```
JSON-RPC at `POST http://127.0.0.1:3847/mcp` — `tools/list` returns the catalog, `tools/call` invokes a tool. Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from `~/.clawdcursor/token`. Stateless — no session init handshake required.

## The simplest path

When you don't need step-level control, hand clawdcursor the whole task:
```
task({"instruction": "open Notepad and type hello"})
```
The built-in pipeline decomposes it, picks the cheapest execution path
(router → blind agent → hybrid → vision fallback), runs it, and returns a trace.
