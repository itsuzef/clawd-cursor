- [ ] `npm run typecheck` clean
- [ ] `npm run test:ci` passing (759/760 baseline; note any new skips)
- [ ] `npm run test:mcp-schema-snapshot` &mdash; if you touched `src/tools/`, the snapshot diff is intentional and committed
- [ ] Manual smoke on at least one OS (specify which: macOS / Windows / Linux)
- [ ] If touching the MCP surface: verified the tool call you changed works end-to-end through stdio AND HTTP

## Risk / scope

<!-- Anything reviewers should pay extra attention to: cross-OS behavior, schema changes, anything that touches the SafetyLayer chokepoint. -->
