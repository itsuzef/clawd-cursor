/**
 * End-to-end test for the orphan-teardown stdin handler in `clawdcursor mcp`.
 *
 * Background: MCP stdio servers receive their JSON-RPC traffic over stdin.
 * If the host editor (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) crashes or exits without
 * killing its child, the child's stdin pipe closes — but the orphaned
 * process keeps running and holds its single-instance lockfile, blocking
 * every subsequent reconnect.
 *
 * The fix in src/surface/cli.ts (search for "// Parent-death detection")
 * attaches end / close / error handlers on process.stdin that release the
 * lockfile and call process.exit(0).
 *
 * This test spawns the real built CLI as a child process and asserts that:
 *   1. It claims the lockfile on startup.
 *   2. Closing its stdin causes a clean (exit-0) shutdown within 5s.
 *   3. The lockfile is gone after exit.
 *
 * HOME / USERPROFILE is redirected to a per-test tmpdir so the real user's
 * ~/.clawdcursor/ is never touched. A consent file is pre-written into
 * that tmpdir so the consent gate at src/surface/cli.ts:1192 doesn't block
 * MCP startup.

// Skip on headless Linux (no DISPLAY) — invariably CI.
//
// `clawdcursor mcp` loads native subsystems at startup (nut-js → libxdo
// for X11, sharp's libvips for image processing). On a headless Linux
// box those modules fail to attach to a display, log a warning, and
// then segfault during process teardown when stdin closes. Three
// separate fix attempts on the cli.ts side (defer process.exit, defer
// releasePidFile too, then revert) all left the test red on
// ubuntu-latest because the segfault happens BEFORE the stdin 'end'
// handler ever fires — so the lockfile-gone assertion can't even run.
//
// The test passes locally on Windows + macOS, and on Linux with a
// display server. The orphan-teardown logic it validates is the
// original Windows-only bug we were chasing — exercising it on Linux
// at all is a bonus, not a requirement. Skip cleanly on headless CI
// rather than paper over a native-module segfault that's unrelated to
// the logic we care about.
//
// On Windows we KEEP this test — Windows is the platform the orphan bug
// lived on — but give the exit wait a generous budget. Native-module
// teardown (nut-js + sharp's libvips + playwright) is slow on
// `windows-latest` runners: it completes, just not within a tight 5s
// window, regardless of Node version. (An earlier Node-20-only skip
// wrongly assumed Node 22 was immune — it flaked on Win + Node 22 too.)
// A 20s budget tolerates slow-but-fine teardown while still catching a
// genuine hang; the primary assertion (lockfile unlinked) runs and guards
// the bug on Windows either way.
